st.title("10 IPO Myths")

# Introduction
st.markdown("""
As cardinal rules come in the groups of 10, so do the myths sometimes. When meeting and discussing 
potential IPOs with various management teams over the years, we consistently came across a persistent 
list of reasons why the management hesitates and those reasons are often rooted in deeply held myths 
which we would like to dispel next. Hopefully these rebuttals will help many entrepreneurs and 
management to get confidence in doing an IPO and investors to consider investing in them.
""")

# Myth 1
st.subheader("Myth 1: IPOs are too expensive.")
st.markdown("""
**Reality:** While IPOs do have associated costs, such as underwriting fees, legal and accounting 
expenses, and marketing costs, the capital raised during the process can significantly outweigh 
these expenses. Moreover, the increased visibility and access to public markets can lead to future 
growth opportunities.
""")

# Myth 2
st.subheader("Myth 2: Loss of control and decision-making power.")
st.markdown("""
**Reality:** While going public involves sharing ownership with external investors, companies can 
still retain control and decision-making power by carefully structuring their share classes and 
establishing a strong board of directors. In fact, for many VC-backed startups, an IPO means 
re-gaining control of their company as the rigorous private conditions usually imposed to them 
by VCs, such as liquidation preferences, drag along and tag along rights, are now lifted.

# Myth 3
st.subheader("Myth 3: Public companies face excessive regulation and scrutiny.")
st.markdown("""
**Reality:** While public companies must adhere to more stringent regulations and reporting 
requirements, these measures help ensure transparency, accountability, and investor confidence, 
which can ultimately benefit the company in the long run.
""")

# Myth 4
st.subheader("Myth 4: Going public is only for large companies.")
st.markdown("""
**Reality:** Companies of various sizes can successfully go public. In fact, many small and 
medium-sized companies have taken advantage of IPOs to raise capital, enhance visibility, and 
accelerate growth.
""")

# Myth 5
st.subheader("Myth 5: The IPO process is too time-consuming.")
st.markdown("""
**Reality:** While preparing for an IPO can take several months, the long-term benefits of going 
public often outweigh the time and effort required. Moreover, a well-prepared company can 
efficiently navigate the IPO process with the help of experienced advisors, and can complete 
the process in as little time as 3-4 months in a best case scenario.
""")

# Myth 6
st.subheader("Myth 6: The company's stock price will always drop after the IPO.")
st.markdown("""
**Reality:** The stock market is inherently unpredictable, and there are no guarantees that a 
company's share price will consistently rise after its IPO. However, by focusing on long-term 
growth and performance, companies can create shareholder value and attract investor interest.
""")

# Myth 7
st.subheader("Myth 7: Companies must be profitable to go public.")
st.markdown("""
**Reality:** While profitability can certainly make a company more attractive to investors, many 
unprofitable companies have successfully gone public, particularly those in high-growth industries 
or with a strong growth potential.
""")

# Myth 8
st.subheader("Myth 8: The IPO process will distract management from day-to-day operations.")
st.markdown("""
**Reality:** While preparing for an IPO can be demanding, companies can minimise disruption by 
engaging experienced advisors and creating a dedicated IPO team, allowing management to remain 
focused on core operations.
""")

# Myth 9
st.subheader("Myth 9: The success of an IPO depends solely on market conditions.")
st.markdown("""
**Reality:** While market conditions can influence an IPO's success, other factors, such as the 
company's financial performance, industry trends, and investor interest, play a significant role 
in determining the outcome.
""")

# Myth 10
st.subheader("Myth 10: Companies can only go public once.")
st.markdown("""
**Reality:** Companies can indeed go public multiple times through secondary offerings or 
follow-on offerings, which allow them to raise additional capital and offer more shares to the 
public. Such offerings can be instrumental in supporting continued growth and expansion.
